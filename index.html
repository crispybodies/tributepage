				<blockquote>A capable treasure hunter with a knack for getting in over his head, Nathan Drake possesses both a deep knowledge of history and the devil's own luck. Though his involvement in treasure hunting provides him with the adrenaline rush he so craves, it hasn't yet yielded much in the way of actual treasure. Loves: researching ancient civilizations and lost artifacts. Hates: clowns.</blockquote>
